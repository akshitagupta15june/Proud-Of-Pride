# Proud-Of-Pride

## Inspiration

Even in the 21st century, there is still a stigma attached to LGBTQ and related issues, leading to discrimination against them in walks of life like healthcare, society, job opportunities, etc.
This makes them susceptible to depression, loneliness, and suicidal tendencies. However, we need to acknowledge their existence and put in efforts for their upliftment and inclusion in various areas.

## What it does

"Proud of Pride" is an all-in-one platform for the LGBTQIA+ community. Feeling Sad and alone? Want to apply for a job? Need to know about inclusive healthcare? Don't worry at all, Proud of Pride is your go-to-go standard. We offer help from verified individuals of the community both at personal and professional platforms, Inspirational and motivational stories of LGBTQ+ communities from the past, Jobs and other Opportunities that focus on diversity and inclusion, and add-on helps like finding homes, healthcare opinions, etc.

## How we built it

We built this website from HTML, CSS, and Javascript and hosted the domain on Go daddy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to devise and build a platform that pays heed to the need of the diverse population under LGBTQ+. We tried our level best to make them feel a part of society by empowering them.

## What we learned

Initially, we were unaware, however, during this project, we researched and were able to become aware of the variety of the problems that the community faces and to understand the gravity of their situation.


## What's next for Proud Of Pride

We plan to tie up with hospitals, NGO's and big platforms like Linkedin.
