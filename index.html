                    One of the best-known LGBTQ+ tech people of all time, Tim Cook stands out as one of the most powerful people in the world. Named Apple CEO in 2011, Tim previously served as the Chief Operating Officer for the brand. Once he came out publicly as gay, he became the first openly gay CEO on the Fortune 500. According to Tim, he felt it was essential to come out and support the gay community.

Tim noted that being gay has been painful and uncomfortable for him at times. However, it also gave him the confidence to be himself and follow the path that he believes in.
